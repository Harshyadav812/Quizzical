# ðŸ§  Quizzical

_Because who doesn't love discovering they know absolutely nothing about anything?_

## What is this?

Quizzical is a React-based quiz app that will humble you faster than you can say "I'm pretty smart actually." Built with the latest React 19 features because, hey, if you're going to fail at trivia, might as well do it with cutting-edge technology.

## Features

- **Random Questions**: Because predictable failure is just boring
- **Multiple Categories**: From science to entertainment - equal opportunity embarrassment
- **Real-time Scoring**: Watch your confidence crumble in real-time
- **Sleek UI**: Pretty enough to distract you from your terrible score
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: Even handles API tantrums better than most people handle quiz results
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on any device while crushing your dreams

## How to Use

1. Click "Start Quiz" (the easy part)
2. Answer 5 seemingly simple questions (plot twist: they're not)
3. Click "Check Answers" (brace yourself)
4. Stare at your score in disbelief
5. Click "Play Again" because apparently you enjoy pain

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Because we like living on the edge
- **Open Trivia Database API** - The source of all your future trust issues
- **CSS** - Making failure look fabulous since forever
- **Your Tears** - Not included in package.json but definitely required

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

_Warning: Side effects may include questioning your entire education and Googling "Am I actually smart?" at 2 AM._

## API

Powered by the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) - because someone out there decided we all needed to be reminded that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, whether we like it or not.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Great! Another thing that's smarter than most quiz-takers. Feel free to submit a PR, but please include tissues for the emotional damage your improvements might cause.

_Remember: It's not about winning or losing, it's about having the audacity to think you knew what the powerhouse of the cell was without Googling it first._

**Disclaimer**: No egos were intentionally harmed in the making of this app. Any damage to self-esteem is purely coincidental and definitely not our fault. Probably.
